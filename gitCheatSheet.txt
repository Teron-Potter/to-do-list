Initialize git, do stuff, git add . OR git add "thing", git commit, goto: do stuff

Best practices
First commit comment "Initial Commit"

git init //starts repo

//to remove in windows just delete .git through explorer
//Caution Terminal delete option can delete system files if you do it wrong! Delete git folder while navigated to dir "rm ./.git -rf"

git add . 
    // adds everything to stage
git add "filename" 
    // adds one specific file
git status 
    // check to see what's in the staging area
git commit -m "Add Commit Comment Here"
    //Should be less than 80 char. and be present tense
git log 
    //view list of commits
git log --oneline 
    //condensed view of log
git checkout "ID from log" 
    //detach head and look at other commit
git checkout "branch name" 
    //return to branch head
git branch 
    // list branches
git checkout -b branchName
    // makes a new branch
git push -u origin branchName
    //links branch to remote and pushes it
git branch -d "name" 
    //(soft) delete branch only works if merged
git branch -D "name" 
    //Force delete any circumstance
git push
    //Push things to remote (GitHub
live-server
    //It's a liver server... what?
