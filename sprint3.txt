//B: 3s4: create a handler for "add new item" form {2}
create function handleNewItem and connect it to the form

blocked by 3s1, 3s3
DoD: when the field is filled in and the button is clicked, the new item should appear at the bottom of the list, the page should NOT reload

//G: 3s1 write a function that adds an item to the DOM {2}
Function will have the signature of appendNewItemToDom(itemDescription: string, completed: boolean = false) -> void
DoD: you can call appendNewItemToDom("get bread"); a new item appears in the list with uncomopleted status
  calling appendNewItemToDom("get bread, true); a new item appears in the list with completed status

Functions that are called outside of context
attaching handlers to specific events
"click", "submit", "scroll" basic events
Event data structure
Accessing the DOM element after event dispatch
Reading values from form field element
DoD: be able to confidently attach an event handler to any element and explain a possible use case
