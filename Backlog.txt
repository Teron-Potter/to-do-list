Item 6: Default array for list items
DOD: Structure contains initial data, data is rendered in the main div on page load, all items should show their respective status

const tasks = [{
    content: "Take out the trash.",
    completed: true
  }, {
    content: "Brush your teeth.",
    completed: false
  }, {
    content: "Take over the world.",
    completed: false
}];

Item 6.1: Learn to add items to an html list, Write a function that takes the title and status and adds item to a html list -> DOM manip happens here // 3
DOD: Function exists and can be demonstrated Function takes the title and status and adds item to a html list -> DOM manip happens here
renderItem("do a thing", false) -> this will add an item at the bottom of the list in HTML

Item 6.4: Write a function that renders the list to the DOM. Iterate through a structure on page load and populate HTML list using the function from 6.1 //2
Blocked by 6.1
DOD function exists and renders the data
HTML list starts empty and is populated by data from the structure on page load
renderAll(tasks) -> this will display items in the list (the function should auto run at load)


Item 8: Write a function that takes input from form in 7, adds the new item to the structure (6) and re-renders the list (6.4) //2
addNewItem("content") -> add the item to the data structure with completed set to false, clear the list in the dom, call renderAll

Item 11: Connect function in Item 8 to a form in item 7 and add basic validation (cannot be blank cannot be bigger than X chars, trim the edges)


Item 9: Functional user input for array removals (Delete Item)
